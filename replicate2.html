<b> What is HTML? </b>
<p>HTMl is really a very simple language. It consists of ordinary text, with tags that are 
enclosed by "<" and ">" </p>
<b> Basic Structure </b>
<p> HTML has 3 required tags. These are html, head, and body. Title is also a very important tag
because it contains information about your website described in the tab or title bar.</p>
