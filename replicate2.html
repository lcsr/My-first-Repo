<b> What is HTML? </b>
<p>HTML is really a very simple language. It consists of ordinary text, with tags that are 
enclosed by "<" and ">" </p>
<b> Basic Structure </b>
<p> HTML has 3 required tags. These are html, head, and body. Title is also a very important tag
because it contains information about your website described in the tab or title bar.</p>

It is also important to remember that HTML tags almost always come in pairs.
<br>
<b> Font Attributes </b>
<p>We can format several different aspects of HTML fonts. Within our font tag, we can add the following 
elements to format size, color, and font family.</p>
<br>
color = "hex color code"
size = "number"
face = "font family">
<br>
<b> Character Formatting </b>
<p> We can change several different aspects of HTML characters.
<b>bold</b> 
<i> italic</i>
